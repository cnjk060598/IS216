Deep Dive: GRID
- Unlimited number of roles                                                     
- A row can container up to a maximum of 12 columns 
- You do not have to use up all of the grid columns
- If you have 3 columns, css will divide 12 by 3 and each area has 4 grid columns 
- <div class="col-sm-2">
    - Rendering how many grid you want for that area 

        <div class="col-sm-2">
            Area 1
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">                
            Area 2
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            Area 3
        </div>

If each coloumn has an idicative number of 6, it will create a new row with 12 coloumns and split it up to 6-6:

        <div class="row" style="background-color: pink; margin-top: 20px;">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              Area 1
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              Area 2
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              Area 3
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                Area 4
            </div>
        </div>
