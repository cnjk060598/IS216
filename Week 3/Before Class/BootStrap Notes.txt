Deep Dives Containers:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Document: Layout - Overview / Containers 
.container: Sets a max-width at each responsive break points
    - (min-width: 576px)

Viewport: Refers to users visible areas of the webpages. Can be physical mobile devices or computer screens. Screen size will varies from device to device 
Width=Device Width: We are telling the web browser to use the width of the device screens 
initial-scale=1: Controls initial zoom level, when the page is first loaded by the web browser
CDN: stands for content delivery network 

Inspect Elements: 
- Open up Developer tools 



Deep Dive: GRID
- Unlimited number of roles                                                     
- A row can container up to a maximum of 12 columns 
- You do not have to use up all of the grid columns
- If you have 3 columns, css will divide 12 by 3 and each area has 4 grid columns 
- <div class="col-sm-2">
    - Rendering how many grid you want for that area 

        <div class="col-sm-2">
            Area 1
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">                
            Area 2
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            Area 3
        </div>

If each coloumn has an idicative number of 6, it will create a new row with 12 coloumns and split it up to 6-6:

        <div class="row" style="background-color: pink; margin-top: 20px;">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              Area 1
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              Area 2
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              Area 3
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                Area 4
            </div>
        </div>

Deep Dive - Navigation and Spacing 

To set margins - search for spacings 

- my-4 
    - m: margin
    - y: Top and bottom 
    - 4: Size 

Navigation: 
<nav class="nav justify-content-center nav-pills flex-column flex-lg-row">



Week 3: Notes

What is the default margin for box modals? 
- use developer tool to check 
    - parent division: <body> 
    - Default Margin: 8px 

Universal Selector: 
    - * means all (* is selector)
    - Remove default padding and margin 
        - Padding: 0
        - margin: 0 

        * {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0; 

        }

- margin-bottom: adding spaces to seperate the boxes
- Collasping margin: when you overlay two elements and add margins to 2 boxes, collasping margin occurs 
    - Main Principal: CSS will take the larger margins out of the two margins indicated. 

How to make image move to the right of the webpage? (Text will be wrapped around the image)
without float, the text will be rendered below the image.

img {
    float: right 
}

- if you put two div, it will become two rows
- display: flex 
    - Use when you want to put two divisions side by side

When you use #ID selector, it is more specific than an element selector
    - ID is more specific
