API - Application Programming  Interface 

The only way the computer system (client) can access the Warehouse IoT-enabled smart warehouse information 
and data is through API.

API controls who can access the system information and data

API is a gateway between the company system, data and everyone else outside of the company 

Front end web app and API app are de-coupled, Front end web app and API app and Database are hosted in 3 different locations (no single point of failure)
(They are physically running in different server)


When starting to code: 
1)  console.log("**** [START] display_default() *****")
2)  console.log("**** [END] display_default() *****")

Skeleton will be given for axios calling API 


    // 1) Complete the endpoint URL with gender appended as a parameter
    let api_endpoint_url = "http://krazywoman.com/krazymatch/api/profile/random.php?g=" + gender
    console.log(api_endpoint_url)

    // 2) Use Axios to call API asynchronously
    axios.get(api_endpoint_url)
    .then(response => {

        // a) Inspect the response.data
        console.log(response.data)

        // b) Populate today-pick-box with new info
        // Feel FREE to create another function to do this work!
        // You don't have to stuff ALL logics here in this function :D
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error.message)
    })
